## Running out of Toilet Paper Makes for a ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’© Day.
## Running out of product can run you out of business.

Tooksome helps businesses know what's in stock, order it, and be alerted before it runs out.

We're building the friendliest inventory and ordering app for anyone with a cellphone or web browser. You can use a barcode scanner if you have one, but it's also built into the app â€” so any employee, with no training, can track stock with the mobile phone they already carry.

It stinks when you run out of basic supplies: you have to make a
special trip, or pay for faster shipping, or at the very least stop
what you're doing to update your shopping list.

And if you sell nine T-shirts but can only find eight, you might lose that customer but you'll definitely lose all the time it takes for customer support and to figure out what went wrong.

Tooksome Base lets any home or small business track their basic supplies and core products. Assembling your shopping list is a breeze. From the first time you open it, you see a standard list of kitchen, office, shop and restroom products, and it's easy to add the rest of what you track. Best of all, online ordering from Amazon is built right in -- you won't run out and you won't be surprised by an automated order you forgot to cancel.

Tooksome Office adds handy stickers that make it super simple for your co-workers to alert you when they take supplies or notice you're
almost out of coffee filters. They just point the camera on their phone at the sticker and hit a button -- no app needs to be
installed. Slack integration lets your coworkers add an item to Tooksome so you don't have to stop working to add to your shopping
list.

## Support Tooksome

To help support tooksome, <a href="https://j.mp/tooksome-amazon" rel="sponsored">click this link</a> and then shop on Amazon â€” maybe stock up on [toilet paper](https://j.mp/tksm-amz-tp) or [a good book](https://j.mp/tksm-amz-bd4c). You don't pay any more than normal, and you don't have to buy any specific product we link to. We'll earn a few cents, but the main thing is that it improves access to the Amazon program interface for our robots.

## Coming Soon

We're live right now as [Snap Inventory](http://j.mp/snap-inventory) on the iOS App Store.

Our next version, for iOS Android and the web, will be released this spring.
